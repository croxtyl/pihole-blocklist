# Big datasets generator

Previously, these repository offered large datasets with blocked domains instead of hundred smaller ones, why not anymore?

was supposed to make everything more orderly and easy, but by the excess of false positives often large datasets brought more problems than good, so it is easier to solve problems with smaller collections. The generator littered github (with commits that took up space on the servers and commit activity on my account) and a small group of people used it and it was suboptimal. These repositories serve the purpose of storing old datasets if someone hasn't changed the sources in their istance pi-hole. Update from https://croxtyl.top/blocklist
